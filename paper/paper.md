# Abstract

Pizza [@pizza2000identification] is an understudied yet widely utilized implement for delivering in-vivo *Solanum lycopersicum* based liquid mediums in a variety of next-generation mastications studies. Here we describe a de novo approach for large scale *T. aestivum* assemblies based on protein folding that drastically reduces the generation time of the mutation rate.

# Introduction

## Background
Dean De Cock produced the Ames Housing dataset for use in data science courses. It's a fantastic alternative for data scientists looking for an updated and enhanced version of the well-known Boston Housing dataset. Dataset used can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

The training dataset comprises 1460 observations and 79 explanatory variables, whereas the test dataset has one less variable because the predicted variable, SalePrice, has been removed. To maintain uniformity in pre-processing, both datasets are combined.

## Initial Data Analysis
Examining the data is one of the first and most crucial processes in data analysis. We can observe that there are missing values in the dataset based on the count. We can also see that the mean and standard deviation differences between variables are rather big.

Many of the "NAs" were recorded because the particular variable was not present in the dwelling, which was unique to our dataset. As a result, some values (mainly from categorical variables) have been replaced with "0." We were able to manage the majority of the missing data this way.
